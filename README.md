We benchmark Frank–Wolfe, Away-Step Frank–Wolfe, and Pairwise Frank–Wolfe on the Maximum Clique Problem. For a graph 
G=(V,E), a clique is a set of vertices with all pairwise edges present; the goal is to find the largest such set. We use the MCP formulation introduced in 
[J. T. Hungerford and F. Rinaldi, 2019] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02486) and evaluate how the three methods perform on this constrained maximization problem.

To test the algorithms, we considered three different datasets from three families of maximum cliques instances belonging to the DIMACS benchmark:
Instances: p_hat300-3, C125.9, hamming8-4.
